    Your multi-agent orchestrator. Design your own pipeline.

    You have access to:
    - BaseAgent: a single ReAct agent you can instantiate with any system prompt
    - prompts.py: ready-made prompts (RESEARCHER_PROMPT, ANALYST_PROMPT,
      WRITER_PROMPT, FACT_CHECKER_PROMPT, PLANNER_PROMPT)
    - The tool registry: search_web and read_webpage are available once
      you've completed the tools/registry.py TODO.

    Ideas to get you started:
    - Chain researcher → analyst → writer in sequence
    - Run researcher and fact-checker in PARALLEL with asyncio.gather(),
      then synthesize their outputs
    - Build a retry loop: if confidence is low, re-run the researcher
    - Add a planner agent that breaks the query into sub-tasks first
    - Invent your own pattern!

    The only requirement: return {"answer": "...", "metadata": {...}}
